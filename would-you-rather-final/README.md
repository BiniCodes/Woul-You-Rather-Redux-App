# Would You Rather App

### A React Redux Project

## About this project

This project was made for the React Developer Nanodegree of Udacity. The purpose was to build a web app that uses React and Redux
to give the functionality to let users play the game "Would You Rather". In this game a user is asked a question in the 
form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Would You Rather App

### A React Redux Project

## About this project

This project was made for the React Developer Nanodegree of Udacity. The purpose was to build a web app that uses React and Redux
to give the functionality to let users play the game "Would You Rather". In this game a user is asked a question in the 
form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start the app

    1) Download the repository

    2) Start the development server with npm start in your command line for the project folder

    3) The app opens automatically in your default browser on localhost 3000

    Note: Make sure Node.js is installed.
